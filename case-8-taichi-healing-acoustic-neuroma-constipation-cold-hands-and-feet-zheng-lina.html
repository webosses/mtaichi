                        <!-- <li><strong>Health problem(s):</strong> acoustic neuroma, constipation, cold hands and feet  </li> -->
                        <li><strong>Name: </strong> Zheng Lina</li>
                        <li><strong>Region: </strong> Chengdu, Sichuan Province </li>
                    </ul>
                   
                   
                 <p>I had an acoustic neuroma when I was 46 years old. I had no choice but to have a craniotomy in hospital. The terrible sequelae caused my facial paralysis, slurred speech, and weak legs and feet, which led to frequent falls. </p>
                 <p>I had to retire early and recuperate at home. During the long days of recuperation, I was eager to recover my health and was always looking for a rehabilitation exercise method that suits me.</p>
                 <p>On September 14, 2018, I participated in the Tai Chi Whole Body Qigong(The Qi Circulation Techniques of Tai Chi) class held by Teacher Xue Wenyu in Chengdu with a try-it mentality. I studied and practiced hard, pondered carefully,  finally I learned the 14 movements. </p>
                 <p>In February 2019, I participated in the public welfare activity of the Whole Body Qigong held by Teacher Xue, with the intention of learning and learning well. In the process of practicing this exercise day after day and year after year, my body has also undergone many unexpected changes, which is really beneficial.</p>
                 <p>First, my whole body is loose and soft. Because I have been resting at home for many years after I got sick, and the amount of exercise is very little, so my body is stiff. During the learning process, Teacher Xue once said that we should maintain natural relaxation in a natural state.</p>
                 <p>This exercise does not require stretching and pulling bones, and each movement is a circular movement. According to this principle, I insisted on practicing every day and was surprised to find that my body had different feelings and changes every day, and I became very loose and soft without realizing it. This set of exercises exercises every part and joint of the body, making all parts of my stiff body flexible.</p>
                 <p>Second, it cures constipation. I have had constipation for many years. After I got sick, the reduced activity made the constipation worse, and I often had a bowel movement once every 5 days. Since I started practicing Tai Chi's whole body Qi circulation method, I could have bowel movements frequently after a month, and I basically went to the toilet every day after two months. </p>
                 <p>Third, it is smooth blood circulation. Sick people have weak qi and shortness of breath, and their blood flow is slow, which is reflected in the cold hands and feet. Before I practiced Tai Chi Qigong, my hands and feet were cold, but after practicing for half a year, they no longer felt cold. Now, after practicing Tai Chi Qigong, my hands and feet are even warm!</p>
                 <p>Since Tai Chi Qigong does not require a large practice area, I insist on practicing regardless of wind or rain. Although I've not yet recovered as healthy as a normal person, I have regained my confidence and firmly believe that my body will get better and better with the help of Tai Chi Qigong (the Qi Circulation Techniques of Tai Chi)!</p>
