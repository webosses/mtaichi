                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Name: </strong>  Jiang Yichuan</li>
                        <li><strong>Region: </strong> Yibin, Sichuan Province </li>
                    </ul>
                   
                   
                  <p>I am Jiang Yichuan, from Yibin, Sichuan Province. I am 63 years old this year. I am writing to express my gratefulness to Teacher Xue for teaching me Li's Ancient Tai Chi (the traditional Li branch Tai Chi) that has cured my chronic kidney disease. The main indicator of urine protein positive 4+ turned to negative 4+ and disappeared. Looking back on my sick self from where I am today is unbearable.</p>
                  <p>I was officially going to retire in August 2020. My family planned that after my retirement we would travel together to famous places of the motherland to see beautiful places and experience interesting folk customs. I felt happy when thinking of these but,unfortunately, I got sick 2 months before retirement. </p>
                  <p>After examination, I was diagnosed with membranous nephropathy (chronic kidney disease). There is no specific medicine that treats it at present. The doctor said: 30% can be cured (with hormones), 30% maintain the status, and 30% develop into uremia. The doctor did not prescribe medicine and recommended conservative treatment. </p>
                  <p>So I went around looking for doctors and medicines, and I found myself spending more than 3,000 yuan a month on medicines but my condition did not improve.</p>
                  <p>At that time, my feet were swollen, and my body immune system continued to decline. It became normal to catch a cold if I was not careful. When I slept at night, I leaned my feet together, and I felt that the upper leg was so heavy that I couldn't lift it. Upon waking up, I couldn't feel my legs. It took a while for my legs to regain normal sensation. I would feel uncomfortable with the wind on my head when I slept.</p>
                  <p>After the physical examination in October 2021, the hospital took the initiative to call me and told me that I suspected cancer cells. I went to the hospital for a follow-up examination one day later. Cancer! I was scared at the time. It seemed that my life would not last long. I thought about it and there was nothing I could do? Forget it, just let it be. I told myself not to be afraid of death and die. I didn't go for the follow-up examination, and I just lived like this.</p>
                  <p>On March 8, 2022, I was introduced to Teacher Xue’s Li’s Ancient Tai Chi by Teacher Luo Jinyu, and bought my first Tai Chi course. As a complete Tai Chi novice, I began to practice Li’s Ancient Tai Chi.</p>
                  <p> After one year and eight months of studying 10 courses, three online and three offline learning sessions, I insisted on practicing Wuji standing meditation, Whole Body Qi  (the Qi circulation techniques of Tai Chi) and Thirteen Postures (5 steps and 8 forces) every day. My body has undergone earth-shattering changes. My physical strength has recovered day by day, my energy improves day by day and my state of health also improves day by day. I am back to being cheerful, happy and energetic every day.</p>
                  <p>So I am very grateful to Master Xue for teaching me the Li's Ancient Tai Chi. Master Xue is not only good at kung fu but also very kind. He cares about his students in every possible way. </p>
                  <p>Finally, I want to tell people from my heart: Li's Ancient Tai Chi is a very good and high-quality kung fu. It’s not just Kung fu, it also nourishes the body and mind. If you have faith with Li’s ancient Tai Chi and practice unremittingly, a better self is definitely waiting for you ahead!</p>
