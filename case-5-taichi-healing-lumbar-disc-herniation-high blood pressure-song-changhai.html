                        <!-- <li><strong>Health problem(s):</strong> lumbar disc herniation, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, </li> -->
                        <li><strong>Name: </strong> Song Changhai</li>
                        <li><strong>Region: </strong> Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province </li>
                    </ul>
                   
                   
                 <p>Before I retired, I was a senior manager of a company. Due to a long-term overloaded of work and an irregular lifestyle, I suffered from severe lumbar disc herniation during my employment, and the "three highs" (high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood lipids) were serious, and my body was always in a sub-healthy (weary) state. </p>
                 <p>In 2010, due to a work-related accident that caused femoral head necrosis, I was forced to undergo femoral head preservation surgery, and was later identified as the first eighth-level disability. I was just 53 years old and was forced to leave my job and retire. It was also at that time that I truly realized the importance of a healthy body to a family.</p>
                 <p>In order to improve my quality of life, I began to look around for exercise methods suitable for my physical rehabilitation. By chance in 2018, I met the Qi Circulation of Taichi practices promoted by Master Xue Wenyu. In July, I became a member of his online class.</p>
                 <p>In October 2018, I participated in his offline class held in Huairou, Beijing, and participated in two offline trainings</p>
                 <p>in 2019. Under the guidance of the master, my movements of the practices are becoming more and more standardized, with the upper and lower parts moving in unison, using the waist to guide the hands, and the mind to lead the Qi, and the sensation of Qi is getting stronger and stronger. After practicing in morning, I will feel refreshed all day.</p>
                  <p>For two years, I have insisted on practicing 4 times a day, and I have felt obvious results. The pain in the waist and legs caused by lumbar disc herniation and femoral head necrosis has basically disappeared. High blood sugar has also been reversed, Blood lipids have basically returned to normal, only blood pressure is still slightly high, and my general state of health has been improved.</p>
                  <p>Now my mental state is better, not only I no longer add burden to my family, but I can also contribute to it as well. The family feels more harmonious and there is endless happiness! I plan to continue the practice of Tai Chi Qigong (The Qi Circulation techniques of Tai Chi) for the rest of my life!</p>
