                 <p>I was born on March 3, 1957. Due to overwork and mental stress when I was young, as I grew older various ailments afflicted me one after another, causing constant pain.</p>
                 <p>I have varicose veins in both legs and cannot stand for a long time. I have bone hyperplasia in my knees and cannot squat down. In May 2018, I also had surgery on my left leg at Renji Hospital. I have loved exercising for many years and was worried that I may not be able to continue. In March 2019, by chance, I participated in the online charity event of Master Xue Wenyu's Tai Chi Qigong (The Qi Circulation Techniques of Tai Chi) through the introduction of a good friend.</p>
                 <p>Through persistent practice, my legs, which were previously unable to squat down, can now able to do so. It is really a great benefit from the practice. Tai Chi Qigong is indeed very magical! Another positive effect for me is that I used to have skin keratosis on my face and had undergone two operations. In August 2019, symptoms appeared next to my forehead again, so I went to the dermatology department of the hospital for treatment. The doctor said that I needed surgery as an outpatient. I completed the procedures, paid the handling fee, and waited for the doctor's notice one month later.</p>
                 <p>At that time, I was practicing the Qi practice of Tai Chi(the Qi circulation techniques of Tai Chi) every day. Although I barely noticed at first, the symptoms gradually subsided andâ€™, after half a month, completely disappeared. I went to the hospital to see a doctor who was immensely surprised and incredulous. Why did I have to undergo surgery when the symptoms were gone? So, the surgery fee was refunded. I was so happy at that time, and the feeling of happiness in my heart really cannot be expressed in words.</p>
                 <p>There are many benefits to practicing the Qi circulation methods of Tai Chi . When practicing, follow the principles of quiet, loose, stable, even, round, and slow required by Teacher Xue, and the whole body will be warm, and there will be a very obvious feeling of smooth blood circulation. </p>
                 <p>Practicing this set of exercises can bring us not only physical health, but also spiritual health, so that our body and mind can always maintain the right attitude of mind and right behavior. </p>
                  <p>Whoever practices properly will come to know and gain from the process. I will continue to practice this set of exercises until I die. I am grateful for the wisdom of my ancestors! I am grateful to all the practitioners who have helped me.</p>
